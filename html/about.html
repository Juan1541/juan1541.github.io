              <p>
                I am a 21-year-old Computer Science Engineer, who's currently a student at CETYS University. I have acquired many skills and knowledge 
                while studying at my university. I am also expanding my skills by practicing and learning in many extra courses I am taking. I hope to 
                grow even more with this company to acquire experience and provide innovative ideas for different projects.

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>
                On top of that, a few more things I like to mention about myself. First of all, I play baseball, mainly as a pitcher. I have been playing
                it since I was just 2 years old. Now I currently play for my university's baseball team. While playing this sport, I have learned many new
                and important lessons that I apply in my everyday life. One example is that I learned how to become a leader for a group of people, this skill
                helps me lead people to achieve our objective, that being a school project or any other type of task to be done and efficient. On top of that,
                I also learn how to communicate with others, which is a big factor in my career, especially since most people in my career tend to be on
                the more timid side. So with this skill, it allows me to speak with confidence and to be able to communicate information with my team members
                in projects and other work as well.
